# Daikatana PAK format

A complete reference for the Daikatana (Ion Storm, 2000) PAK archive
format as implemented by pakka.

Daikatana paks share Quake's `PACK` magic and 12-byte header but widen
the directory record from 64 to 72 bytes, adding a per-entry
`compressed_length` and `is_compressed` flag. Compressed entries use a
custom byte-codec (LZSS-style) documented in §3 below.

encoder output through the decoder in `test/dk_codec_test.c`, and
cross-validated against `dkpak`-produced output in
`test/fixtures/dk/`.

## 2. File layout

### 2.1 Header — 12 bytes

| Offset | Size | Field       | Notes                                          |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 4    | `signature` | `"PACK"` — bit-identical to Quake / Q2 PAK.    |
| 4      | 4    | `diroffset` | u32 LE — byte offset of the directory block.   |
| 8      | 4    | `dirlength` | u32 LE — directory size in bytes (72 × N).     |

Because the magic collides with Quake PAK, an open-time layout probe
disambiguates: each candidate geometry (64-byte Quake row vs 72-byte
Daikatana row) is validated against every directory entry's
offset + on-disk extent vs the file size. If exactly one parses
cleanly, it wins; if both parse, callers must pass `--format
daikatana` (or `PAKKA_FORMAT_DAIKATANA` to `pakka_open_ex`) to
disambiguate. Empty archives (`dirlength == 0`) bias to Quake PAK
unless the DK hint is explicit. See `probe_pak_layout` in
`src/pakfile.c`.

### 2.2 Directory entry — 72 bytes

| Offset | Size | Field               | Notes                                                                |
| ------ | ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 56   | `filename`          | NUL-padded; forward-slash path separators.                           |
| 56     | 4    | `file_pos`          | u32 LE — offset of payload bytes in the archive.                     |
| 60     | 4    | `file_length`       | u32 LE — **uncompressed** size.                                      |
| 64     | 4    | `compressed_length` | u32 LE — on-disk byte extent for compressed entries; 0 for STORED.   |
| 68     | 4    | `is_compressed`     | u32 LE — `0` = STORED (raw bytes), non-zero = encoded per §3.        |

**Mixed STORED + compressed in the same archive is legal.** Compression
is a per-entry decision; the same archive can carry both. pakka's
encoder uses this to apply compression selectively (§5).

**`file_length` is always the uncompressed size.** For STORED entries
this is also the on-disk byte extent; for compressed entries the
on-disk extent is `compressed_length`. Every site in pakka that walks
the byte layout — `copy_between_paks`, `compute_payload_end`,
`write_pak_directory` — routes through the
`pak_entry_on_disk_extent(e)` helper to pick the right value.

### 2.3 Endianness and limits

Every on-disk u32 is little-endian regardless of host byte order. In
pakka the directory I/O sites use `pakka_read_u32_le` /
`pakka_write_u32_le` from `src/common.c`; the CI matrix includes a
big-endian s390x job to keep this honest. Offsets and lengths are
capped at `UINT32_MAX` (4 GiB) at every write site.

### 2.4 Quake-vs-Daikatana disambiguation — decision table

Both Quake PAK and Daikatana use the `"PACK"` magic, so the open-time
layout probe in `src/pakfile.c::probe_pak_layout` has to disambiguate
geometry. The probe runs two checks per candidate row size (64-byte
Quake vs 72-byte Daikatana): first that `dirlength` divides evenly
into the row, then that every directory entry's `file_pos +
on-disk extent` lands inside the captured file size and that
`file_pos >= PAKFILE_HEADER_SIZE` (12). The decision table:

| Quake probe (64-byte rows) | DK probe (72-byte rows) | Result                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OK                         | divisibility-fail (`% 72 ≠ 0`) | Quake (`PAKKA_FORMAT_PAK`).                                                                                |
| divisibility-fail (`% 64 ≠ 0`) | OK                  | Daikatana (`PAKKA_FORMAT_DAIKATANA`).                                                                             |
| OK                         | extent-fail (`% 72 == 0` but entries don't fit) | Quake.                                                                                |
| extent-fail (`% 64 == 0` but entries don't fit) | OK                 | Daikatana — the common shipping-DK case, since `compressed_length` only makes sense in 72-byte rows.              |
| OK                         | OK                      | Ambiguous → `PAKKA_ERR_FORMAT` ("Ambiguous PACK archive (parses as both Quake and Daikatana); pass --format pak or --format daikatana"). |
| Fail (any reason)          | Fail (any reason)       | `PAKKA_ERR_FORMAT` ("PACK archive does not parse as Quake or Daikatana (entry offset/length out of range)").      |
| `dirlength == 0` (empty)   | `dirlength == 0` (empty) | Short-circuited to Quake (`PAKKA_FORMAT_PAK`) without running either probe — empties would trivially pass both. Pass `--format daikatana` to force DK identity. |

An explicit `format_hint` from `pakka_open_ex` or `--format` short-
circuits the probe entirely — the hint is asserted against the
on-disk magic and the row size is taken from the hint. This is the
safe path for callers who know what they have.

In practice every shipping Daikatana pak has at least one
compressed entry, so the 72-byte row's extra `compressed_length`
field validates the on-disk extent and the 64-byte row's extent
check fails. Synthetic fixtures live at `test/dk_test.c`:
`test_ambiguous_576_rejected` exercises the "both probes fail"
path (a 576-byte all-zero directory that divides into both row
sizes but whose zeroed `file_pos` fails the `file_pos >= 12`
check under both layouts); `test_create_empty_then_open_with_hint`
exercises the empty-archive short-circuit. There is currently no
fixture for the genuine both-probes-pass ambiguity — that would
need a hand-crafted directory whose row layout is consistent under
both 64- and 72-byte interpretations.

## 3. Wire format: byte-codec opcode table

Compressed entries (`is_compressed != 0`) carry a stream of variable-
length opcodes. The decoder reads one control byte `c` at a time and
dispatches:

| Control byte | Class       | Length expression | Payload                    | Output                                                |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x00..0x3F` | literal run | `c + 1` (1..64)   | `c+1` raw bytes from input | Copy them straight to output.                         |
| `0x40..0x7F` | zero run    | `c - 0x3E` (2..65)| (none)                     | Write `c - 0x3E` zero bytes.                          |
| `0x80..0xBF` | byte run    | `c - 0x7E` (2..65)| 1 byte                     | Write the payload byte `c - 0x7E` times.              |
| `0xC0..0xFD` | back-ref    | `c - 0xBE` (2..63)| 1 byte (`off`)             | Copy `c - 0xBE` bytes from `produced - (off + 2)`.    |
| `0xFE`       | invalid     | —                 | —                          | Format error.                                         |
| `0xFF`       | terminator  | —                 | (none)                     | End of stream.                                        |

Back-reference distance is `off + 2`, range `2..257`. The copy is into
*already-decoded output*, so LZ-style overlap is legal: when the copy
length exceeds the distance, the freshly-written tail bytes feed back
into the same copy operation, repeating a window of `distance` bytes.
The decoder must do this byte-by-byte (not `memcpy` / `memmove`) for
correctness.

**Termination.** A well-formed stream ends with `0xFF`, but the decoder
also accepts clean input exhaustion provided `produced == out_len`. Any
under-fill (`produced < out_len` at end-of-input) is a format error.

**Strict bounds.** Every input read is checked against `in_len`, every
output write against `out_len`, every back-reference distance against
`produced`. Any violation returns `PAKKA_ERR_FORMAT`; the output tail
beyond the failure point is left uninitialised and callers must treat
partial output as garbage.

### 3.1 Implementation in pakka

`pakka_dk_inflate(const unsigned char *in, size_t in_len,
                  unsigned char *out, size_t out_len, pakka_error_t *err)`
in `src/dk_codec.c`. Whole-buffer decode — pakka allocates a buffer
of size `entry->file_length` and runs the codec to completion. The
per-archive `max_decompressed` cap (default 64 MiB, settable via
`pakka_set_max_decompressed_size`) bounds peak RSS against a malicious
or accidentally-oversized declared `file_length`.

## 4. Encoder strategy

pakka's `pakka_dk_deflate` is a single-pass greedy matcher over the
back-reference distance range (2..257). At each input position it
gathers four candidate encodings, picks the best by token cost, and
emits.

### 4.1 Candidate tokens

For each input position `i`:

- **`z` — zero-run length.** Largest `n` such that `in[i .. i+n-1]`
  are all `0x00`, capped at `DK_MAX_ZERO_RUN = 64`.
- **`r` — byte-RLE length.** Largest `n` such that `in[i .. i+n-1]`
  are all `in[i]`, capped at `DK_MAX_BYTE_RUN = 64`.
- **`m` / `dist` — best back-reference.** Searches distances `d` in
  `[2, 257]` for the longest match starting at `i`, with match length
  capped at `min(DK_MAX_BACK_REF, d, remaining)` where
  `DK_MAX_BACK_REF = 62`. The fast-path filter `in[i - d] != in[i]`
  skips most candidates without the inner loop.
- **literal byte** — always available as a fallback (cost 1 byte
  amortised inside a 64-byte literal run).

### 4.2 Conservative caps

The encoder uses caps **one step inside** the decoder envelope:

| Token        | Decoder accepts | Encoder emits |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------- |
| Zero run     | 2..65           | 2..64         |
| Byte-RLE     | 2..65           | 2..64         |
| Back-ref     | 2..63           | 3..62         |
| Literal      | 1..64           | 1..64         |

A length-2 byte-RLE or back-ref is a 2-byte opcode replacing 2
literal bytes — break-even on bytes, but it splits any in-progress
literal run and forces a re-open downstream. Skipping these tokens
avoids encodings that almost always cost more than they save.

### 4.3 No-overlap rule

The encoder caps each back-reference at length ≤ distance. The
decoder accepts longer back-refs via LZ-style overlap (§3), but the
encoder skips that case. Cost in compression ratio is small (overlap
matches only win for highly repetitive patterns like `"ababab..."`) and
the benefit is a single-pass matcher with no overlap special case.

### 4.4 Decision tree

Once `z`, `r`, `m` are gathered, sub-threshold candidates are zeroed
out (the minimum profitable lengths are zero-run 2, byte-RLE and
back-ref 3, capturing the per-token byte cost). The remaining choice:

```
if (z == 0 && r == 0 && m == 0) {
    emit literal byte (deferred — accumulated in a 64-byte run)
} else if (z * 2 > r && z * 2 > m) {
    emit zero-run of length z
} else if (m > r) {
    emit back-ref of length m at distance dist
} else {
    emit byte-RLE of length r
}
```

**Zero-run preference (the `2 ×` tiebreak).** A zero-run is a 1-byte
opcode (no payload). Byte-RLE and back-ref are 2-byte opcodes (op +
payload). At equal length the zero-run saves one byte vs the
alternatives, so it deserves preference; doubling the score reflects
that asymmetry across a range of competing lengths.

**Greedy.** No deferred matching or lazy evaluation. Whichever encoding
wins at position `i` is committed immediately, and `i` advances by the
match length. Greedy is enough for typical Daikatana content
(palettized images, BSP files); the round-trip test suite catches any
encoder bug that would produce decoder-invalid output.

### 4.5 Worst-case output bound

Worst case is literal-only: every input byte costs 1 byte plus
`ceil(in_len / 64)` opcode bytes plus 1 terminator. In u64:

```
worst = in_len + (in_len + 63) / 64 + 1
```

For `in_len = 4 GiB - 1` this slightly exceeds `UINT32_MAX`. Callers
(see `pakka_add_file` and `pakka_add_memory` in `src/pakfile.c`)
compute this bound in `uint64_t`, compare against `UINT32_MAX`, and
skip the encoder entirely if it would overflow — falling back to
STORED for the source. The on-disk `compressed_length` field is u32,
so anything that wouldn't fit must be STORED.

### 4.6 STORED auto-fallback

After encoding, the caller compares `encoded_size` against
`source_size`. If the encoded form is **not strictly smaller** than the
source, the entry is rewritten as STORED instead — same policy as
info-zip and as pakka's PK3 / PK4 DEFLATE add path. The directory's
`is_compressed` flag is cleared and `compressed_length` left at 0.

## 5. Add-path extension policy

pakka applies the encoder automatically based on the entry name's
extension. The five extensions Daniel Gibson's gist documents as
"compressed when packing" are the policy in `src/pakfile.c`'s
`dk_compressible_extension`:

| Extension | Typical Daikatana content                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.tga`    | Targa textures.                                          |
| `.bmp`    | Windows bitmap textures.                                 |
| `.wal`    | Quake 2-style wall textures (palettized).                |
| `.pcx`    | PCX images.                                              |
| `.bsp`    | Compiled map files.                                      |

Match is case-insensitive, ASCII-only (no `tolower()` — locale-
dependent). Everything else is STORED. There is no user knob;
`--compress` stays a PK3 / PK4 affordance. DK callers select between
STORED and compressed by naming entries appropriately.

## 6. I/O integration

### 6.1 Reading

`pakka_open_ex(path, PAKKA_OPEN_READ, PAKKA_FORMAT_DAIKATANA, ...)` skips
the PACK ambiguity probe and asserts the on-disk magic is `PACK`. The
directory loader parses 72-byte rows including the two extra u32s; on
mixed-archive content the per-entry `is_compressed` flag drives whether
`pakka_open_entry` / `pakka_reader_read` route through the codec or read
raw bytes.

### 6.2 Writing

`pakka_create(path, PAKKA_FORMAT_DAIKATANA, ...)` opens a temp file and
stamps a 12-byte `PACK` header with `dirlength = 0`. Subsequent
`pakka_add_file` / `pakka_add_memory` calls run the encoder per the
extension policy (§5) and update the in-memory entry list with
`dk_is_compressed` / `dk_compressed_size`. Commit modes:

- **Add-only.** `pakka_commit` (also called implicitly by
  `pakka_close`) writes the directory at byte-offset
  `tail->offset + pak_entry_on_disk_extent(tail)` and rewrites the
  header.
- **Rebuild.** Any `pakka_delete` forces a rebuild via a scratch temp:
  surviving entries get copied (their on-disk extents, opaque to the
  rebuild — compressed entries pass through unchanged), a fresh
  directory is written, and the scratch is renamed over the original.

The 4 GiB append-limit check uses the **physical** write size (encoded
or STORED, whichever was committed), not `entry->length`. Set in
`pakka_add_file` / `pakka_add_memory` via `physical_size`.

### 6.3 Verify

`pakka_verify` walks every entry, runs the name-safety check, streams
the payload to confirm `offset` and on-disk extent point at readable
bytes, and flags portable-union collisions on extraction. With
`PAKKA_VERIFY_DEEP`, compressed entries are inflated through
`pakka_dk_inflate` to confirm the byte-codec stream is well-formed and
produces exactly `file_length` output bytes (the same exact-length
contract the on-disk format requires).

## 7. Cross-format notes

DK shares the `PACK` magic with Quake / Q2 PAK and the 56-byte
filename field. The differences are entirely in the directory layout
(72 vs 64 bytes) and the compression flag. pakka's PAK-class geometry
table in `src/common.c` enumerates the three rows side by side:

```
                   signature  name_field_len  dir_entry_size  has_compression
Quake / Q2 PAK      "PACK"            56               64             no
SiN                 "SPAK"           120              128             no
Daikatana           "PACK"            56               72            yes
```

Every PAK-class read/write site dispatches off the row, so adding a
new variant means appending a row, not forking every code path.

## 8. Test coverage

- `test/dk_codec_test.c` — direct codec exerciser. Decoder covers
  every opcode class, bounds violations, termination contracts.
  Encoder covers empty input, single literal, zero run, byte-RLE,
  alternating pattern (back-ref), high-entropy fallback, undersized
  output buffer, and a 4 KiB mixed-payload round-trip.
- `test/dk_test.c` — end-to-end CLI tests. STORED open / extract,
  compressed open / extract, create empty, add STORED (non-listed
  ext), add compressed (listed ext + redundant payload), add STORED
  fallback (listed ext + incompressible payload), mixed-extension
  layout check, delete-with-compressed-survivors round-trip, deep
  verify on both synthetic and pakka-built archives, ambiguity
  detection.
- `test/c_api_test.c` — public API round-trip: `pakka_create` for
  DK + `pakka_add_memory` of compressible bytes + `pakka_close` +
  `pakka_open_ex` with DK hint + `pakka_read_entry_alloc` + memcmp.

Cross-validation against an external encoder is wired up at
`test/fixtures/dk/`: synthetic input bytes (`inputs/*`, generated by
`inputs/generate.py`) are packed into `user.pak` by `dkpak`;
`test/dk_test.c` consumes the result and byte-compares every
extracted payload against the committed source. The case hard-fails
when `user.pak` is missing so accidental deletion can't silently
drop the coverage.
